The reliance on technology in modern society has created a significant barrier in the form of password management.  Many people struggle to remember their passwords because there are so many online services and platforms.  Some people even use weak passwords or use the same password across all platforms.   This is fraught with danger.   To address this issue, we created a tool called the Password Manager Tool. 
This tool has been specifically designed to ensure both safety and usability.   Users can generate strong, unpredictable passwords, securely store them, and retrieve them as needed.   Individuals must create a unique password known as a master password before using the tool.   This master password's security is ensured by storing it in a specialized manner using a cryptographic technique known as hashing. 
When creating a new password, users can specify the length and character types, such as uppercase letters, numbers, or symbols.   Following that, the tool generates a random password for the user.   The passwords are saved in a file that users can access whenever they want.   If the file is missing, the tool will notify the user that no passwords have been stored thus far. 
The tool also evaluates the password strength.   The length of the password and the composition of its characters are scrutinized by the system.   As a result, it classifies the password as weak, moderate, or strong.   Another notable feature of the tool is its ability to estimate how long it will take an individual to crack the password by systematically attempting numerous combinations.   This informs users about the level of security associated with their password. 
The Python programming language was used to create the tool.   It makes use of pre-existing Python tools like random to generate random passwords and hashlib to store the master password in a unique way. 
Finally, the Password Manager Tool is an excellent way to assist people in safeguarding their online accounts.   It ensures that users have strong passwords and protects them.   In the future, we can improve the system by incorporating new features such as using advanced encryption methods to securely store passwords or making password retrieval easier for users.
